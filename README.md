# React Vanilla Form
> An unobstrusive form serializer and validator that works by following standards.

<br />

Vanilla Form is a form serialization and validation component built upon
standards. To obtain the serialized form data the only thing you need to
do is to declare your form controls (native or custom!) following the
standard input interfaces: Using `name`, `htmlFor` and `role` properties
and wiring `onSubmit` prop to `Form` component.
